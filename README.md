# Energy-Efficient-OFDM-with-Intelligent-PAPR-aware-Adaptive-Modulation
Overview:
This repository contains the implementation of an adaptive modulation scheme that enhances the energy efficiency of Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) systems. The scheme is designed with a specific focus on mitigating the high peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR), a common issue in OFDM, using intelligent, online deep learning-based methods.

By optimizing power allocation and modulation per subcarrier, the approach aims to maximize the energy efficiency of OFDM transmissions, crucial for modern wireless networks such as 6G. The proposed method showcases improved energy efficiency and reduced PAPR compared to traditional PAPR-unaware OFDM systems.
